# Earthquake-Wave-Image-Renew
Use matlab-originated function (seismictomo) to generate earthquake wave occasion, and use traditional image processing method to renew such image as well as possible. These methods include Random Kaczmarz method (RK) and also Greedy Kaczmarz method (GK). During the coding process, we try to make preprocessing method(SRTT/Gaussian/CountSketch).
